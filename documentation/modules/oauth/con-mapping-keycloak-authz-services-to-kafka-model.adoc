= Mapping Keycloak Authorization Services to the Kafka authorization model

[role="_abstract"]

To grant Kafka permissions to user accounts or service accounts, you first create an OAuth _client_ specification for the Kafka broker in Keycloak. You then specify Keycloak Authorization Services rules on the client.
Typically, the client id of the broker OAuth client is `kafka`.

The `kafka` client definition must have the *Authorization Enabled* option enabled in the Keycloak Admin Console.

All permissions exist within the scope of the `kafka` client. If you have different Kafka clusters configured with different OAuth client IDs, they each need a separate set of permissions even though they're part of the same Keycloak realm.

When the Kafka client uses OAUTHBEARER authentication, the Keycloak authorizer (`KeycloakRBACAuthorizer`) uses the access token of the current session to retrieve a list of grants from the Keycloak server.
To retrieve the grants, the authorizer evaluates the Keycloak Authorization Services policies and permissions.

.Authorization scopes for Kafka permissions

An initial Keycloak configuration usually involves uploading authorization scopes to create a list of all possible actions that can be performed on each Kafka resource type.
This step is performed once only, before defining any permissions.
You can add authorization scopes manually instead of uploading them.

Authorization scopes should contain all the possible Kafka permissions regardless of the resource type:

* `Create`
* `Write`
* `Read`
* `Delete`
* `Describe`
* `Alter`
* `DescribeConfig`
* `AlterConfig`
* `ClusterAction`
* `IdempotentWrite`

.Defining resource patterns for permissions checks

The resources use pattern names for pattern matching against the targeted resources when performing permission checks.
The general pattern format is `__RESOURCE-TYPE:PATTERN-NAME__`.

The resource types mirror the Kafka authorization model.
The pattern allows for two matching options:

* Exact matching (when the pattern does not end with `\*`)
* Prefix matching (when the pattern ends with `*`)

.Example patterns for resources
[source]
----
Topic:my-topic
Topic:orders-*
Group:orders-*
Cluster:*
----

Additionally, the general pattern format can be prefixed by `kafka-cluster:__CLUSTER-NAME__` followed by a comma, where _CLUSTER-NAME_ refers to the `metadata.name` in the Kafka custom resource.

.Example patterns for resources with cluster prefix
[source]
----
kafka-cluster:my-cluster,Topic:*
kafka-cluster:*,Group:b_*
----

When the `kafka-cluster` prefix is missing, it is assumed to be `kafka-cluster:*`.

When defining a resource, you can associate it with a list of possible authorization scopes which are relevant to the resource.
Set whatever actions make sense for the targeted resource type.

Though you may add any authorization scope to any resource, only the scopes supported by the resource type are considered for access control.

.About policies

Policies are used to target permissions to one or more user accounts or service accounts.
Targeting can refer to:

* Specific user or service accounts
* Realm roles or client roles
* User groups
* JavaScript rules to match a client IP address

A policy is given a unique name and can be reused to target multiple permissions to multiple resources.

.Permissions to grant access

Use fine-grained permissions to pull together the policies, resources, and authorization scopes that grant access to users.

The name of each permission should clearly define which permissions it grants to which users.
