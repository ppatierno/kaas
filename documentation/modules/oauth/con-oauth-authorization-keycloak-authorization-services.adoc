= Managing policies and permissions in Keycloak Authorization Services

This section describes the mappings between Kafka's authorization model and the Keycloak Authorization Services model.
Keycloak Authorization Services is part of Keycloak.
The mappings are used when granting permissions to access Kafka.

//ACTION: Create new concept module
== Kafka and Keycloak authorization models

It's useful to understand the differences between Kafka's authorization model and the model used in Keycloak Authorization Services.

=== Kafka authorization

Kafka's authorization model defines _resource types_ and the available permissions for each type.
When a Kafka client performs an action on a broker, the broker uses a configured authorizer to check the client's permissions based on the action and the resource type.

Kafka has five resource types for controlling access: `Topic`, `Group`, `Cluster`, `TransactionalId`, and `DelegationToken`.
Each resource type has different permissions.

*Topic*

* `Create`
* `Write`
* `Read`
* `Delete`
* `Describe`
* `DescribeConfigs`
* `Alter`
* `AlterConfigs`

*Group*

* `Read`
* `Describe`
* `Delete`

*Cluster*

*  `Create`
*  `Describe`
*  `Alter`
*  `DescribeConfigs`
*  `AlterConfigs`
*  `IdempotentWrite`
*  `ClusterAction`

*TransactionalId*

*  `Describe`
*  `Write`

*DelegationToken*

* `Describe`

=== Keycloak Authorization Services model

Keycloak Authorization Services has four concepts for defining and granting permissions: _resources_, _authorization scopes_, _policies_, and _permissions_.

Resources:: Sets of resource definitions used to match resources with permitted actions.
A resource might be an individual topic, for example, or all topics with names starting with the same prefix.
A resource definition is associated with a set of available authorization scopes, which represent a set of all actions available on the resource.
Often, only a subset of these actions is actually permitted.

Authorization scopes:: Authorization scopes are sets of all the available actions on specific resource types.
When you define a new resource, you add scopes from the set of all scopes.

Policies:: Policies are rules that use criteria to match against a list of accounts.
Policies can match _service accounts_ based on client ID or roles, or _user accounts_ based on username, groups, or roles.

Permissions:: Permissions grant a subset of authorization scopes on a specific resource definition to a set of users.

//ACTION: create new concept module
== Mapping Keycloak Authorization Services to the Kafka authorization model

To grant Kafka permissions to user accounts or service accounts, use Keycloak Authorization Services rules on the OAuth client that represents the Kafka Broker.
Typically, the client id of the OAuth client is `kafka`.

Your OAuth 2.0 client definition for the Kafka Broker must have the *Authorization Enabled* option enabled.

All permissions exist within the scope of this OAuth 2.0 client, so if you have different Kafka clusters configured with different OAuth 2.0 client IDs they would each have a separate set of permissions even though they're part of the same realm.

When the Kafka client uses OAUTHBEARER authentication, the Keycloak authorizer (`KeycloakRBACAuthorizer`) uses the access token of the current session to retrieve a list of grants for the current session from the Keycloak server.
The authorizer evaluates the Keycloak Authorization Services policies and permissions in order to retrieve the list of grants.

.About authorization scopes

An initial Keycloak configuration usually involves uploading authorization scopes to create a list of all possible actions that can be performed on each Kafka resource type.
This step is performed once only, before defining any permissions.
Alternatively, you can add authorization scopes manually.

Authorization scopes should contain all the possible Kafka permissions regardless of the resource type:

* `Create`
* `Write`
* `Read`
* `Delete`
* `Describe`
* `Alter`
* `DescribeConfig`
* `AlterConfig`
* `ClusterAction`
* `IdempotentWrite`

.Defining resource patterns for permissions checks

The resources use pattern names for pattern matching against the targeted resources when performing permission checks.

The general pattern is `__RESOURCE-TYPE:PATTERN-NAME__`.

The resource types mirror the Kafka authorization model.
The pattern allows for two matching options:

* Exact matching (when the pattern does not end with `\*`)
* Prefix matching (when the pattern ends with `*`)

.Example patterns for resources
[source]
----
Topic:my-topic
Topic:orders-*
Group:orders-*
Cluster:*
----

Additionally, the general pattern can be prefixed by `kafka-cluster:__CLUSTER-NAME__` followed by a comma, where _CLUSTER-NAME_ refers to the `metadata.name` in the Kafka custom resource.

.Example patterns for resources with cluster prefix
[source]
----
kafka-cluster:my-cluster,Topic:*
kafka-cluster:*,Group:b_*
----

When the `kafka-cluster` prefix is missing, it is assumed to be `kafka-cluster:*`.

When defining a resource, you can associate a list of possible authorization scopes which are relevant to the resource.
Set whatever actions make sense for the targeted resource type.

Though you may add any authorization scope to any resource, only the scopes supported by the resource type are considered for access control.

.About policies

Policies are used to target permissions to one or more user accounts or service accounts.
Targeting can refer to:

* Specific user or service accounts
* Realm roles or client roles
* User groups
* JavaScript rules to match a client IP address

A policy is given a unique name and can be reused to target multiple permissions to multiple resources.

.Defining permissions based on scopes, resources, and policies

Use fine-grained permissions to pull together the policies, resources, and authorization scopes that grant access to users.

The name of each permission should clearly define what permissions it grants to which users.

== Example permissions required for Kafka operations

The following examples demonstrate the user permissions required for performing common operations on Kafka.

.Creating a topic

To create a topic, the `Create` permission is required for the specific topic, or for `Cluster:kafka-cluster`.

[source,shell]
----
bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --topic my-topic \
  --bootstrap-server my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --command-config=/tmp/config.properties
----

.Listing the topic

If a user has the `Describe` permission on the topic, the topic is listed.

[source,shell]
----
bin/kafka-topics.sh --list \
  --bootstrap-server my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --command-config=/tmp/config.properties
----

.Displaying the topic details

To display the topic details, `Describe` and `DescribeConfigs` permissions are required on the topic.

[source,shell]
----
bin/kafka-topics.sh --describe --topic my-topic \
  --bootstrap-server my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --command-config=/tmp/config.properties
----

.Producing to the topic

To produce messages to the topic, `Describe` and `Write` permissions are required on the topic.
If the topic hasn't been created yet, and topic auto-creation is enabled, the permissions to create the topic are required.

[source,shell]
----
bin/kafka-console-producer.sh  --topic my-topic \
  --broker-list my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --producer.config=/tmp/config.properties
----

.Consuming from the topic

To consume messages from the topic, `Describe` and `Read` permissions are required on the topic.
Consuming from the topic normally relies on storing the consumer offsets in a consumer group,
which requires additional `Describe` and `Read` permissions on the consumer group.

Two `resources` are needed for matching. For example:
[source]
----
Topic:my-topic
Group:my-group-*
----

[source,shell]
----
bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --topic my-topic --group my-group-1 --from-beginning \
  --bootstrap-server my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --consumer.config /tmp/config.properties
----

.Producing to the topic using an idempotent producer

Besides needing the permissions for standard producing to the topic, an additional `IdempotentWrite` permission is required on the `Cluster` resource.

Two `resources` are needed for matching. For example:

----
Topic:my-topic
Cluster:kafka-cluster
----

.Listing consumer groups

When listing consumer groups, only the groups on which the user has the `Describe` permissions are returned.
Alternatively, if the user has the `Describe` permission on the `Cluster:kafka-cluster`, all the consumer groups are returned.

[source,shell]
----
bin/kafka-consumer-groups.sh --list \
  --bootstrap-server my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --command-config=/tmp/config.properties
----

.Displaying the consumer group details

To display the consumer group details, the `Describe` permission is required on the group the topic associated with the group.

[source,shell]
----
bin/kafka-consumer-groups.sh --describe --group my-group-1 \
  --bootstrap-server my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --command-config=/tmp/config.properties
----

.Changing the topic configuration

To change the topic configuration, the `Describe` and `Alter` permissions are required on the topic.

[source,shell]
----
bin/kafka-topics.sh --alter --topic my-topic --partitions 2 \
  --bootstrap-server my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --command-config=/tmp/config.properties
----

.Displaying the Kafka broker configuration

In order to use `kafka-configs.sh` to get the broker configuration, the `DescribeConfigs` permission is required on the `Cluster:kafka-cluster`.

[source,shell]
----
bin/kafka-configs.sh --entity-type brokers --entity-name 0 --describe --all \
  --bootstrap-server my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --command-config=/tmp/config.properties
----

.Changing the Kafka broker configuration

To change the Kafka broker configuration, `DescribeConfigs` and `AlterConfigs` permissions are required on `Cluster:kafka-cluster`.

[source,shell]
----
bin/kafka-configs --entity-type brokers --entity-name 0 --alter --add-config log.cleaner.threads=2 \
  --bootstrap-server my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --command-config=/tmp/config.properties
----

.Deleting a topic

To delete the topic, the `Describe` and `Delete` permissions are required on the topic.

[source,shell]
----
bin/kafka-topics.sh --delete --topic my-topic \
  --bootstrap-server my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --command-config=/tmp/config.properties
----

.Selecting a leader partition

To run leader selection for topic partitions, the `Alter` permission is required on the `Cluster:kafka-cluster`.

[source,shell]
----
bin/kafka-leader-election.sh --topic my-topic --partition 0 --election-type PREFERRED  /
  --bootstrap-server my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --admin.config /tmp/config.properties
----

.Reassigning partitions

To generate a partition reassignment file, `Describe` permissions are required on the topics involved.

[source,shell]
----
bin/kafka-reassign-partitions.sh --topics-to-move-json-file /tmp/topics-to-move.json --broker-list "0,1" --generate \
  --bootstrap-server my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --command-config /tmp/config.properties > /tmp/partition-reassignment.json
----

To execute the partition reassignment, `Describe` and `Alter` permissions are required on `Cluster:kafka-cluster`. Also, `Describe` permissions are required on the topics involved.

[source,shell]
----
bin/kafka-reassign-partitions.sh --reassignment-json-file /tmp/partition-reassignment.json --execute \
  --bootstrap-server my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --command-config /tmp/config.properties
----

To verify partition reassignment, `Describe`, and `AlterConfigs` permissions are required on `Cluster:kafka-cluster`, and on each of the topics involved.

[source,shell]
----
bin/kafka-reassign-partitions.sh --reassignment-json-file /tmp/partition-reassignment.json --verify \
  --bootstrap-server my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --command-config /tmp/config.properties
----
